homer_video_backg


this a simple modification to get a video background in your selfhosted homer dashboard.\
just overwrite the existing files in your current [homer dashboard](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer) installation.\
dont forget to create the video/ directory and put a video in it.\
the app.*.css is only needed to play the video beneath the colored header.
